   - GL vs Bank statement matching
   - Discrepancy detection and flagging
   - Multi-format output (CSV, JSON)
   - 88.89% reconciliation rate achieved

3. backend/accruals.py (330 lines)
   - AccrualCalculator class
   - Interest accrual calculation (5% annual rate)
   - Depreciation calculation (straight-line method)
   - Expense accrual calculation

   - Configurable accrual rates

4. backend/financial_statements.py (384 lines)
   - FinancialStatementGenerator class
   - Profit & Loss Statement generation

   - Error handling and reporting
   - JSON results output
   - Process summary generation

6. index.html (520 lines)
   - Beautiful gradient UI design
   - Real-time data loading from JSON
   - Interactive approval/rejection workflow
   - Approval history tracking with timestamps
   - Status badge system (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   - Responsive grid layout

SAMPLE DATA:
------------
1. general_ledger.csv - 9 GL transactions
2. bank_statement.csv - 9 bank transactions
3. transactions.csv - 30 detailed transactions
4. accruals.csv - 3 accrual specifications

OUTPUT FILES GENERATED:
-----------------------
1. reconciliation_matched.csv - Matched transactions
2. reconciliation_unmatched_gl.csv - Unmatched GL items
3. reconciliation_unmatched_bank.csv - Unmatched bank items
4. reconciliation_discrepancies.csv - Flagged discrepancies
5. reconciliation_summary.json - Summary report
6. journal_entries.json - Journal entries (JSON)
7. journal_entries.csv - Journal entries (CSV)
8. financial_statements.json - Complete financial statements
9. month_end_close_results.json - Complete process results

RESULTS WITH SAMPLE DATA:
-------------------------
Reconciliation:
- 9 GL transactions processed
- 9 Bank transactions processed
- 8 transactions matched (88.89% success rate)
- 1 unmatched GL transaction
- 1 unmatched bank transaction
- 0 discrepancies flagged

Accruals:
- 3 journal entries generated
- £2,166.67 total debits
- £2,166.67 total credits
- Balanced: YES
- Types: Interest, Depreciation, Insurance

Financial Statements:
- Revenue: £42,000.00
- COGS: £5,000.00
- Gross Profit: £37,000.00
- Operating Expenses: £12,200.00
- Net Income: £24,800.00
- Total Assets: £74,800.00
- Total Liabilities: £0.00
- Total Equity: £74,800.00
- Balance Sheet Balanced: YES

TECHNICAL FEATURES:
-------------------
✓ Uses Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
✓ Modular architecture - each component can run independently
✓ Comprehensive docstrings and code comments
✓ Type hints for better code clarity
✓ Error handling throughout
✓ Multiple output formats (CSV, JSON)
✓ Configurable parameters
✓ Sample data included for testing
✓ Clean separation of concerns
✓ Production-ready structure

USAGE:
------
1. Run the process:
   $ python run_month_end_close.py

2. Open the dashboard:
   $ open index.html
   (or navigate to the file in your browser)

3. Review and approve/reject each component

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
--------------------
- Database integration (replace CSV with SQL/NoSQL)
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced reconciliation algorithms (ML-based)
- REST API for backend processes
- Email notifications for approvals
- Multi-level approval workflows
- PDF report generation
- ERP system integration
- Scheduled automated runs

CONCLUSION:
-----------
All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.
The system is modular, well-documented, and ready for demonstration or further
development into a production system.
